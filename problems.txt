1.I was trying the place the error handling and httperror middleware code above the routes defined .So the routes were not getting executed .
->Always define the routes before the middlewares and the error handlers 

2.Database connection with mongoose and the async ,await.Here the connection was not succesful beacues the db_uri was undefined.

3.Promises and the async await syntax
