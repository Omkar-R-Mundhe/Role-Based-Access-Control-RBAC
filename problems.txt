1.I was trying the place the error handling and httperror middleware code above the routes defined .So the routes were not getting executed .
->Always define the routes before the middlewares and the error handlers 

2.Database connection with mongoose and the async ,await.Here the connection was not succesful beacues the db_uri was undefined.

3.Promises and the async await syntax

4.When I am trying to link the style page with the header it was not able to find the path beacuse of a simple mistake of middlware .The app.use was written instead app.set which was making all the problem 

5.serving static files from the current file was making the  request to wrong route
GET /auth/register 304 6.073 ms - -
GET /auth/style.css 404 1.613 ms - 36
so changed the relative route.

6.what is the window .history back event ?
